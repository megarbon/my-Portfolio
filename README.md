# Astro Portfolio by Melaku Garcia

## Project Description

This portfolio website was built using [Astro](https://docs.astro.build), a fast static site generator, and styled with the help of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Astro is a static site generator that combines the best of both server rendering and static site generation. It allows for blazing-fast loading times and highly optimized web applications.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed, reusable classes to streamline the styling process. It enables rapid development and ensures a consistent design system.

The portfolio website includes:

- Minimalistic Landing Page
- Contact information
- A downloadable CV
- Access to my current projects
